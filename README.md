# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## About my project:
I developed a dynamic and responsive shoe-selling website using React JS and Tailwind CSS. This project showcases modern web development techniques, offering a seamless user experience with fast load times and intuitive navigation. Tailwind CSS ensures a sleek, mobile-friendly design, while React JS powers the interactive features, including product browsing, filtering, and cart management.
